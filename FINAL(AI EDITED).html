      Interactive ICT Fun Facts
    </h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Information and Communications Technology continues to evolve rapidly,
      shaping how people communicate, work, and access information.
      While many concepts in ICT are discussed in classrooms, there are several
      important facts and ideas that are often overlooked or briefly mentioned.
      This website aims to provide a deeper look into selected ICT-related topics
      in a clear and organized manner.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      This project is a student-created educational website designed to present
      extended ICT fun facts in a readable and engaging format. Each fact is
      explained in more detail to help students better understand the background,
      significance, and impact of various ICT developments. The content is
      intended for academic learning and reference purposes only.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Topic Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding ICT goes beyond knowing how to use tools and software.
      It also involves learning how technologies developed, why certain systems
      were created, and how they influence modern digital practices.
      By exploring these facts, students can gain broader knowledge that supports
      critical thinking and informed use of technology.
    </p>

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>

    <!-- FACTS WITH DETAILED INFO -->

    <div class="fact">
      <p><strong>1. The Internet Was Originally Designed for Communication During Emergencies</strong></p>
      <img src="internet.jpg" alt="Early Internet Network">
      <p>The internet originated from the ARPANET project funded by the U.S. Department of Defense in the late 1960s. Its design focused on resilience, ensuring communication could continue even if certain network nodes were damaged or destroyed during emergencies, making it highly decentralized.</p>
    </div>
